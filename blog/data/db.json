      "body": "In the world of software and technologyprojects speak louder than certificates. While online courses and certifications demonstrate your willingness to learn hands-on projects prove your ability to build and solve real problems. Recruiters often look beyond qualifications to see whether youve applied your knowledge in meaningful ways—whether thats through a full-stack web app, a machine learning model, or an open-source contribution. Projects showcase your creativity, problem-solving mindset, and technical depth in a way that certificates simply cant. They also make your resume stand out and serve as excellent talking points during interviews. In short, building and sharing real-world projects is one of the best ways to learn, grow, and get noticed in the tech industry."
